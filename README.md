# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the study of applications of software in making work easier.
in industry  its applied to make work easier by employing the AI techniques

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
change analysis,release analysis and system  implementation.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning, requirements, design and prototype, software development, testing, deployment, and maintance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is appropriate for a project with well defined requirements that seem not to change while Agile methodologies 
promotes thorough  planning.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer- oversees software  programs, test software in various  phases, lay out  designs,build modules and communicate.
Quality assurance engineer,Determine general and specific quality requirements for products.Create manual and automated software tests to identify functionality issues.Analyze testing results and implement or communicate solutions to developers.Review final product functionality before commercial release.
project manager- creates the plan that is necessary  to complete a task for software engineering 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
